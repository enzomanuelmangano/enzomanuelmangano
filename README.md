### Hi there 👋

I'm a student of Computer Science Engineering at the University Federico II (Naples, Italy). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [React Native Reanimated YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjHsmVtnAr9TWoMAh-3QMiP7bPUqPFuFZ)
- 🧑‍💻 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a React Native Dev but I like Flutter 😮
